# private

- Functions that are defined in the body of other functions cannot be
  tested easily and clutter the body of the parent function, itâ€™s also
  not always clear if they use lexical scoping or not
- If we move these functions to the namespace they make the codebase
  harder to understand because we lose this relationship

{private} proposes a solution to these problems.

## Installation

Install with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("moodymudskipper/private")
```

## Example

``` r
library(private)
print_cubed <- function(x) {
  x |> cube() |> format()
}
print_cubed %private% cube <- function(x) {x * square(x)}
# this works recursively
print_cubed %private% cube %private% square <- function(x) {x^2}
print_cubed %private% format <- function(x) {paste("Square value:", x)}

print_cubed(3)
#> [1] "Square value: 27"

# parents have a printing method
print_cubed
#> <private_parent> (R_GlobalEnv) with children: cube(), format()
#> function(x) {
#>   x |> cube() |> format()
#> }
#> <environment: 0x11f03c3c8>

# children too
print_cubed %private% format
#> <private_child>
#> function(x) {paste("Square value:", x)}

# they work together
print_cubed %private% cube
#> <private_child>
#> <private_parent> (R_GlobalEnv) with children: square()
#> function(x) {x * square(x)}
#> <environment: 0x11f0dfe88>

# private closures are not bound to the local environment (the namespace if we're in a package)
ls()
#> [1] "print_cubed"

# we can test the private methods
(print_cubed %private% cube)(4)
#> [1] 64
```
